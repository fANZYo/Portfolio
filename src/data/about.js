It wasn\'t until 10 years later, though, that I realized I wanted to do this full-time.</p><h2>Tottenham Hotspur</h2><p>After some prepping time teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I was lucky enough to land my first job in an agency with big clients like Suzuki, Tottenham Hotspur, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and more.</p><p>It was a massive opportunity for me to learn the ropes which started off by doing bug fixing and learning system design on the newly built Spurs website. We were close to launch when the client came back to us with performance concerns. The website was brand new, yet taking 5 seconds to load on a good connection. The rest of the team was struggling to pinpoint the cause so, ambitious like I am, I went and did some research. A few days later, I came back and was proud to present my fidings full of new and inspiring practices. We fixed the issue and the website was now loading in less than 1 second. I was now on the companies radar and I had found myself a passion for website performance. This was thrilling.</p><p>After a few quiet months, I eventually had the amazing opportunity to lead the development of Scope, one of the largest disability charities in the UK. I was still a junior developer then.</p><h2>Scope</h2><p>Scope was going through a digital transformation and needed their main website rebuilt from the ground up with goals to improve performance and become a symbol for accessibility. We worked for six months alongside accessibility experts to reach these goals. During this period, with the same ambitious mindset, I soaked up knowledge like a sponge, learning about how users of assistive technologies navigate websites, accessibility guidelines, the impact of design, and much more. Needless to say my previously acquired knowledge on performance proved usefull too. Six months and a ton of learnings later, we launched their brand new website. It was a massive success and we ended up meeting WCAG AAA requirements, winning the <a href="https://bima.co.uk/celebrating-the-very-very-best-in-british-digital-2/">BIMA Best website 2019 award</a>, and reaching website load time below 1 second.</p><h2>Then</h2><p>My experiences in this agency was invigorating and has set me on a path thriving for performant and accessible websites, built with well architected code, all of which I now simply refer to as user experience. Presently, I help companies and organizations build awesome websites and applications that offers great user experience for everyone alike.</p>',
